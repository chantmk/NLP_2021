# POS Tagging

We provide basic_ff_embedding.pt as a pretrained word embedding in the resources.zip 

For this demo and homework you will need to install additional libraries, python-crfsuite and tensorflow-addons.

python-crfsuite - is a python implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for labeling sequential data.
(https://python-crfsuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

tensorflow-addons - is a extension of tensorflow 2, which provide additional layers, activations, loss functions, optimizers, etc for many advance deep learning tasks. All of these additional modules can be used in conjunction with the native tensorflow 2.  
(https://www.tensorflow.org/addons)

tf2crf - is a simple wrapup for CRF module of tensorflow-addons(tfa.text.crf).
